Use evaluation criteria in .doc file from last homework 
to see and get ideas what to improve in your code




1. Refactoring - first small canges, just method and variables names. 







2. Bug fixing - F5 debug and find problems / compare example
 input with output

3. Unit testing - F12 helps find selected items (like paramers
 needed to create new item) it the solution. Use 2 variables (expected
 and actual) when Assert. Can use System.Linq when need .count or else.
Can use Assert.AreEqual or Assert.AreSame(when must compare 2 objects). 
CollectionAssert.AreEqual when testing collections

4. Refactoring - extract methods from complex and big classes and etc.

5. Documentation - over the method/class ///
